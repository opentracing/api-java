 * span's operation name, timing, or log data, but merely any unique identifiers (etc) needed to
 * contextualize it within a larger trace tree.
 *
 * <p>SpanContexts are sufficient to propagate the, well, *context* of a particular trace between
 * processes.
 *
 * <p>SpanContext also support a simple string map of "trace attributes". These trace attributes
 * are special in that they are propagated *in-band*, presumably alongside application data. See the
 * documentation for {@link #setAttribute(String, String)} for more details and some important

  /**
   * Sets a tag on this SpanContext that also propagates to future children per {@link

   *
   * <p>Trace attributes enables powerful functionality given a full-stack opentracing integration
   * (e.g., arbitrary application data from a mobile app can make it, transparently, all the way
   * into the depths of a storage system), and with it some powerful costs: use this feature with
   * care.
   *
   * <p>IMPORTANT NOTE #1: This will only propagate trace attributes to *future* children of the
   * TraceContextSource#newChild(TraceContext)} and/or the Span that references it.
   *
   * <p>IMPORTANT NOTE #2: Use this thoughtfully and with care. Every key and value is copied into
   * every local *and remote* child of this TraceContext, and that can add up to a lot of network
   * and cpu overhead.
   *
   * <p>IMPORTANT NOTE #3: Trace attributes keys have a restricted format: implementations may wish
   * to use them as HTTP header keys (or key suffixes), and of course HTTP headers are case
   * insensitive.
   *
   * @param restrictedKey MUST match the regular expression `(?i:[a-z0-9][-a-z0-9]*)` and is
   * case-insensitive. That is, it must start with a letter or number, and the remaining characters
   * must be letters, numbers, or hyphens. undefined behavior results if the `restrictedKey` does
   * not meet these criteria.
